# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Enterprise Video Processing Platform is a high-performance, scalable system designed to download, process, merge, and compress video content with GPU acceleration and enterprise-grade features. The platform supports batch processing of video URLs, intelligent compression, hardware acceleration, and provides both API and CLI interfaces for maximum flexibility.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a content manager, I want to download multiple video episodes from URLs and merge them into a single season file, so that I can efficiently organize and distribute video content.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user provides a list of video URLs THEN the system SHALL download each video concurrently with resumable downloads
2. WHEN downloading videos THEN the system SHALL support yt-dlp integration for platform-specific optimizations
3. WHEN all videos are downloaded THEN the system SHALL merge them into a single output file maintaining episode order
4. IF a download fails THEN the system SHALL retry up to 3 times with exponential backoff
5. WHEN processing is complete THEN the system SHALL provide the final merged video file path

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the platform to utilize available hardware acceleration, so that video processing is optimized for performance and efficiency.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system starts THEN it SHALL detect available GPU hardware (NVIDIA, AMD, Intel, Apple Silicon)
2. IF GPU acceleration is available THEN the system SHALL use hardware-accelerated encoding (NVENC, VAAPI, VideoToolbox)
3. WHEN processing videos THEN the system SHALL automatically select optimal encoding parameters based on detected hardware
4. IF hardware acceleration fails THEN the system SHALL fallback to CPU-based processing
5. WHEN GPU is unavailable THEN the system SHALL use optimized CPU encoding with multi-threading

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to interact with the platform through both REST API and CLI interfaces, so that I can integrate it into different workflows and automation systems.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing the API THEN the system SHALL provide FastAPI-based REST endpoints for job management
2. WHEN creating a processing job THEN the system SHALL return a unique job ID and estimated completion time
3. WHEN querying job status THEN the system SHALL provide real-time progress updates via WebSocket connections
4. WHEN using CLI THEN the system SHALL accept video URLs and configuration parameters
5. WHEN job is complete THEN the system SHALL send notifications via configured webhooks

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a content processor, I want intelligent video compression with quality optimization, so that output files maintain high quality while minimizing file size.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing videos THEN the system SHALL analyze video content to determine optimal compression settings
2. WHEN compressing THEN the system SHALL support multiple quality presets (480p, 720p, 1080p, 2160p)
3. WHEN encoding THEN the system SHALL use adaptive bitrate based on content complexity
4. WHEN merging videos THEN the system SHALL maintain consistent quality across all episodes
5. WHEN compression is complete THEN the system SHALL verify output quality meets specified requirements

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As an operations engineer, I want comprehensive monitoring and logging capabilities, so that I can track system performance and troubleshoot issues effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system is running THEN it SHALL expose Prometheus metrics for monitoring
2. WHEN processing jobs THEN the system SHALL log detailed progress and performance metrics
3. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL capture comprehensive error information with stack traces
4. WHEN jobs complete THEN the system SHALL record processing statistics (time, file sizes, compression ratios)
5. WHEN system resources are constrained THEN the system SHALL provide alerts and resource usage metrics

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a platform user, I want reliable job management with queue processing, so that multiple video processing tasks can be handled efficiently without system overload.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN multiple jobs are submitted THEN the system SHALL queue them using Celery with Redis backend
2. WHEN processing jobs THEN the system SHALL limit concurrent operations based on system resources
3. WHEN a job is queued THEN the system SHALL provide priority-based scheduling
4. IF a job fails THEN the system SHALL support manual retry and cancellation
5. WHEN system restarts THEN the system SHALL resume interrupted jobs from last checkpoint

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a security administrator, I want proper authentication and authorization controls, so that only authorized users can access and manage video processing jobs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing the API THEN users SHALL authenticate using JWT tokens or API keys
2. WHEN creating jobs THEN the system SHALL validate user permissions for the requested operation
3. WHEN accessing job data THEN users SHALL only see jobs they own or have permission to view
4. WHEN processing sensitive content THEN the system SHALL encrypt temporary files and secure data transmission
5. WHEN audit is required THEN the system SHALL maintain comprehensive access logs

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a deployment engineer, I want containerized deployment with Kubernetes support, so that the platform can be deployed and scaled in cloud environments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN deploying THEN the system SHALL provide Docker containers for all components
2. WHEN scaling THEN the system SHALL support horizontal scaling via Kubernetes deployments
3. WHEN configuring THEN the system SHALL use environment variables and ConfigMaps for configuration
4. WHEN storing data THEN the system SHALL support persistent volumes for temporary and output storage
5. WHEN monitoring THEN the system SHALL integrate with Prometheus and Grafana for observability

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a performance engineer, I want parallel processing capabilities with Rust performance modules, so that CPU-intensive operations are optimized for maximum throughput.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN downloading large files THEN the system SHALL use Rust-based parallel chunk downloading
2. WHEN processing video segments THEN the system SHALL utilize multi-core processing with Rust modules
3. WHEN performing I/O operations THEN the system SHALL use memory-mapped files for optimal performance
4. WHEN handling concurrent requests THEN the system SHALL maintain low latency and high throughput
5. WHEN system resources are limited THEN the system SHALL automatically adjust parallelism levels

### Requirement 10

**User Story:** As a content manager, I want flexible storage options with cloud integration, so that processed videos can be stored in various storage backends.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN storing output files THEN the system SHALL support local filesystem, S3, and MinIO storage backends
2. WHEN managing temporary files THEN the system SHALL automatically clean up intermediate files after processing
3. WHEN archiving content THEN the system SHALL support configurable retention policies
4. WHEN accessing stored files THEN the system SHALL provide secure download URLs with expiration
5. WHEN storage is full THEN the system SHALL provide alerts and automatic cleanup of old temporary files
