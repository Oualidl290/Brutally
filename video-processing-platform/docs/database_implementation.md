## Usage Patterns

### Basic Operations
```python
# Create database service
async with get_database_service() as db:
    # Create user
    user = await db.users.create_user("username", "email", "password")
    
    # Create job
    job = await db.jobs.create_job(user.id, "season", urls, data)
    
    # Track progress
    await db.jobs.update_progress(job.id, "downloading", 50)
    
    # Commit changes
    await db.commit()
```

### Advanced Queries
```python
# Get job statistics
stats = await db.jobs.get_job_stats(user_id)

# Search files
files = await db.storage.search_files("query", file_type="video")

# Get audit trail
actions = await db.audit.get_user_actions(user_id)
```

### Cleanup Operations
```python
# Automated cleanup
results = await db_manager.cleanup_old_data(days=30)
```
